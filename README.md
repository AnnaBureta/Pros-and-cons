# Jira
Jira documentation is pretty easy to find. At first, I simply googled "Jira documentation" and there it was, as the first hit. It's also rather uncomplicated to find when you are a logged-in Jira user: ![image](domowa7.png)

**Jira - Pros**

 1. Easy to find
 2. **Search** option available: ![image](domowa2.png)
 3. Informal language, e.g. *Ready to get going? Let's start with grabbing the installer.* [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/setting-up-your-instance-861255641.html#Settingupyourinstance-Downloadtheinstaller)
 4. Good-sized images within the text: ![image](domowa3.png) ![image](domowa6.png)
 5. There's a link to the Atlassian Community on every page: ![image](domowa4.png)
 6. When you are reading a topic, there is **Related content** available on the right side of the article: ![image](domowa8.png)
 7. Nice-looking, simple font



**Jira - Cons**
1. **Let's get started**, **Next** buttons - unreadable, wrong choice of colors: ![image](domowa1.png) 
2. In Chrome, you are unable to click on an image and enlarge it, e.g. [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/managing-permissions-861255652.html) or [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver/viewing-a-project-938846234.html)
3. [Here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/working-in-a-project-861255674.html), the *Learn more* lines should not be separated with an enter from the upper paragraphs to which they actually belong because it creates chaos in the layout and the reader can easily click on the topic they are not interested in: ![image](domowa5.png)
